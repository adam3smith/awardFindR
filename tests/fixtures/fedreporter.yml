        project will develop a professional development (PD) model to support teachers
        in implementing an early literacy Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) in
        early childhood classrooms to improve reading outcomes for children who are
        at risk for reading disabilities. MTSS provides varying levels (tiers) of
        instruction to students based on assessments that are used in data-based decision
        making by educators. Early childhood educators are rarely provided instruction
        in the philosophy and fundamentals of explicit instruction, curriculum-based
        assessment, data-based decision making, and individualized instruction. Thus,
        there is a critical need for feasible, effective, and sustainable PD that
        prepares early childhood educators to implement an MTSS model to support students
        in learning to read as they enter kindergarten and beyond. This project aims
        to reduce preventable reading disabilities by improving the ability of educators
        to implement an early literacy MTSS model. An iterative process will be used
        to develop an efficient, promising, and sustainable PD model to prepare early
        childhood teachers to implement an early literacy MTSS model. Data from focus
        groups, interviews, surveys, and observational measures will be used to inform
        the development and revision of the PD model and assess its feasibility. A
        small cluster randomized controlled trial will investigate the promise of
        efficacy of the PD model for improving educators'' implementation of an early
        literacy MTSS model and, ultimately, children''s literacy outcomes. The products
        of this project include a fully-developed PD model (including the tools and

        take place in two phases. In Phase 1, CBC procedures and behavioral strategies
        will be iteratively developed and refined for middle school students with

        project will result in a validated measure to assess listening fatigue for
        children in grades 1–12 with hearing loss and other communication-based disabilities.
        Previous studies indicate that school-age children with hearing loss and specific
        language impairment are at increased risk for listening fatigue in their classes.
        Increased listening effort and the associated stress and fatigue can jeopardize
        the ability to learn, thus increasing the risk for problems in school. The
        development of a valid, sensitive measure of listening fatigue is critical
        to improving the understanding of fatigue in children with communication-based
        disabilities and is a prerequisite for the development and assessment of effective
        intervention strategies for students with communication disorders. In Phase
        1 of this project, researchers will gather qualitative data on fatigue outcomes
        through focus groups and cognitive interviews. Results will inform the development
        of the scale and experts will review the content at the end of this phase.
        In Phase 2, researchers will conduct a preliminary test of the developed fatigue
        scale to run psychometric analyses that inform revisions. In Phase 3, the
        fatigue scale will be field tested for further psychometric analyses to inform
        final revisions and complete the tool. Finally, a user manual will be written
        and made available, along with the measure, on the Internet. This project
        will result in a fully validated measure of listening fatigue and a companion

        language learners (ELLs) are at particularly high risk for poor education
        outcomes due to poor reading performance. This risk becomes more apparent
        as ELLs progress through school and knowledge of academic language becomes
        increasingly important for learning. This project will extend a web-based
        intelligent tutoring system,Intelligent Tutoring using Structure Strategy
        (ITSS), designed to teach students explicit strategies for using knowledge
        of the structure of informational text to improve understanding. Prior research
        has found that students who use ITSS improve their reading comprehension.
        The new intervention, Structure Strategy with Web-Based Adaptive Tutoring
        for EL Learners (SWELL), will be designed to help Spanish-speaking ELLs. SWELL
        will add new components to ITSS that will provide scaffolded materials in
        Spanish and/or simplified versions of English materials, and then adjust the
        delivery of scaffolds based on student progress to transition toward materials
        that are all in English.  The research team will develop SWELL through a series
        of iterative studies in which components for the five structures are gradually
        created, tested, and revised. Students will be tested to determine the most
        appropriate learning conditions given their language proficiency, and then
        receive Spanish-scaffolded and/or enhanced English materials to best meet
        their needs. Teacher and student input will be gathered via focus groups and
        interviews and student performance will be assessed on measures of strategy
        use as well as reading comprehension. The pilot study will compare reading
        comprehension of ELLs using the final version of SWELL with performance of
        students in similar classrooms using typical techniques for teaching reading

        This project will take place in secondary schools across Arizona including
        74 low-performing Title I Priority schools, 37 high-performing Title I ''Reward''
        schools, and 37 Title I ''Focus'' schools in which large gaps exist between

        a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative analysis of administrative
        data sources with qualitative data techniques (i.e., classroom observations,
        focus group interviews, or surveys). The partnership will review 11 statewide
        data sets that include student characteristics, test scores and graduation
        rates; teacher characteristics; and school-level improvement strategies and

        both reading and writing are necessary for success in school and the workplace,
        the vast majority of research and intervention development has focused on
        reading skills. Most of this research suggests that early intervention is
        important to improving reading achievement. However, less is known about writing,
        and fewer interventions have been developed to help students learn to write.
        Still, research in writing that has been completed to date suggests that early
        intervention may be important. Before learning how to compose long texts,
        children must first learn skills such as transcription (mechanics of writing,
        such as spelling and handwriting) and text-generation (translating thoughts
        into text). The current project aims to develop a writing intervention for
        kindergarten children. Building on the Peer-Assisted Learning Strategies (PALS)
        framework, this new writing intervention, Peer Assisted Writing Strategies
        (PAWS) will allow for increased learning time as pairs of students are asked
        to work together to complete highly structured activities aimed at increasing
        writing skill.  The goals of this project are to develop, design, field test,
        and provide feasibility data regarding a kindergarten writing intervention.
        The study will involve five phases: development, exploratory implementation,
        refined implementation, a pilot test of feasibility, and wrap-up and final
        modifications. The implementation phases and pilot study will involve 90 to
        135 kindergarten students each, and modifications to the intervention will
        be made between each implementation based on the data collected. Each implementation
        phase and the pilot study will include a group of comparison classrooms, and
        students'' progress in writing will be compared between the intervention and
        comparison classrooms. Data used for the refinement of the intervention will
        include teacher focus groups and interviews, assessment of videotaped lessons,
        and student writing outcomes.  The final product of this study will be the
        fully-developed PAWS writing intervention for kindergarten students. Peer

        of cognitive rehabilitation for persistent symptoms of mild traumatic brain
        injury (mTBI).  The trial included four treatment arms: psychoeducational,
        computer-based cognitive rehabilitation, therapist-directed cognitive rehabilitation
        and a combination of therapist-directed cognitive rehabilitation plus psychotherapeutic
        intervention.  SCORE’s partner study, iSCORE, collected several brain magnetic
        resonance images (MRI) from a subset of SCORE! study participants before,
        during and after the six-week SCORE! treatment interventions. The final MRI
        session was conducted 12 months after baseline SCORE! assessment. The present
        study proposes to collect occupational, functional and symptom outcome measurements
        from SCORE! participants 1-5 years following SCORE! baseline assessment.  These
        outcomes will be collected via semi-structured telephone interview, medical

        Prostate cancer remains the most common non-skin cancer diagnosed among men
        in the United States. Treatment for localized prostate cancer can result in
        substantial changes in urinary, sexual, and bowel function, and advanced prostate
        cancer and its treatment can cause pain, fatigue, weakness, and other constitutional
        symptoms. Yet our preliminary work indicates that patients are often unaware
        of the magnitude of their dysfunctions relative to expected outcomes after
        prostate cancer treatment. In developing a system to accurately represent
        these changes to patients, we applied user-centered design to create quality
        of life (QOL) dashboards that graphically display survey results. Yet the
        patient-centered orientation relied on focus groups and interviews with patients
        participating in local support groups. As such, educations levels and health
        literacy scores were high among participants.Objective: The objective of this
        study is to increase the generalizability of QOL dashboards and ensure comprehension
        by men of underserved races and ethnicities and those at risk for lower health
        literacy through a partnered research project with the California IMPACT (Improving
        Access, Counseling, and Treatment for Californians with Prostate Cancer) program,
        which provides free prostate cancer care to underinsured men who make at most
        200% of the Federal Poverty Level.Specific Aims: To design QOL dashboards
        that are accessible to underserved men with prostate cancer with variable
        health literacy, we will (1) characterize the health literacy, numeracy, graphic
        literacy, and information access preferences of prostate cancer patients at
        risk for low health literacy; (2) develop alternative QOL dashboard formats
        for presentation to men with variable health literacy; and (3) evaluate the
        comprehension and preferences of IMPACT patients for candidate QOL dashboard
        formats.Study Design: In this research study, we will conduct focus groups
        with IMPACT participants at all stages of prostate cancer to understand what
        QOL questions and concerns are important to racial and ethnic minorities with
        prostate cancer. A design stage with a Patient Advisory Board comprised of
        IMPACT participants will construct prototype QOL dashboards aligned with themes
        elicited from focus groups. Individual interviews will then test comprehension
        and preferences for different QOL dashboard formats to understand how a data
        presentation system can meet the self-management needs of underserved racial/ethnic
        minorities, including men at risk for low health literacy who have prostate
        cancer. We will further assess preferences for modes of data presentation
        in order to develop workflows that will increase access to this content among
        underserved racial and ethnic minorities with prostate cancer.Impact: This
        project represents an innovative initiative to integrate QOL measurement into
        the clinical care of all prostate cancer patients, regardless of patients’
        literacy capabilities. Findings from this study have a potential for immediate
        broad implementation through a web-based platform funded by the Movember Foundation
        that has implemented design concepts from the preliminary work into an interactive
        self-management system targeting men at all stages of prostate cancer.","terms":"

        disorders (EDs), including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating
        disorder, are pernicious conditions with the highest mortality rate of any
        psychiatric disorder. They also are extremely impairing, more so than nearly
        any other psychiatric disorder, and individuals with EDs are high users of
        healthcare, given the physical complications of these conditions. Yet, EDs
        remain understudied among Veterans, possibly due to the misperception that
        members of this population do not suffer from EDs. Recent findings contradict
        this belief, as studies by the Initiating Principal Investigator have demonstrated
        that both male and female Veterans have rates of EDs that are at least as
        high as, if not higher than, the general U.S. population. Military and Veteran-specific
        risk/maintenance factors for EDs, such as difficulty conforming to military
        weight and fitness standards and exposure to military sexual trauma and combat,
        may operate together with earlier childhood factors to contribute to the onset
        of EDs. Thus, Veterans may be particularly vulnerable to EDs. Veterans with
        EDs are likely to be high users of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare,
        but given the lack of national screening or treatment programs, the ED may
        be undetected. This proposal will fill crucial gaps in the literature and
        validate screening measures of EDs in post-9/11 Veterans to enable detection
        and early intervention for these debilitating conditions.This application
        focuses on EDs and addresses several Fiscal Year 2017 Peer Reviewed Medical
        Research Program Areas for Encouragement, including prevalence of diagnosable
        EDs and other clinically significant disordered eating, associations between
        ED symptoms and military-unique behaviors and conditions, and treatment patterns
        of individuals with EDs. We will establish a cohort of post-9/11 Veterans
        who were separated from Service within the past year in order to: (1a) Examine
        the prevalence of full/subthreshold EDs among male and female Veterans. (1b)
        Examine the proportion of full/subthreshold EDs among vulnerable subgroups
        of Veterans. (1c) Examine temporal associations among EDs and comorbid disorders,
        including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and
        alcohol and substance use disorders. (2a) Document treatment patterns and
        healthcare preferences among male and female Veterans with probable full/subthreshold
        ED diagnoses. (2b) Compare treatment patterns for Veterans with probable full/subthreshold
        ED diagnoses to Veterans without ED diagnoses. (2c) Identify barriers to care
        for Veterans seeking mental health treatment in general and for EDs specifically.
        (3) Identify the impact of general and military/Veteran-specific risk/maintenance
        factors for ED symptoms and investigate gender differences. (4) Validate and
        compare two existing, scalable, screening measures of EDs in a Veteran sample.This
        will be a cross-sectional study. Participants will be randomly selected from
        the roster of Veterans who separated from Service within the past year. Names
        will be provided by the VA/Department of Defense (DoD) Identity Repository
        (VADIR), a VA office with access to DoD records. We will recruit a sample
        of 2100 Veterans to complete a mailed survey. Survey respondents whose scores
        exceed clinical cutoffs on ED screening measures, as well as an age- and sex-matched
        sample of healthy controls, will be selected to participate in a telephone
        interview. ED diagnoses will be confirmed, and participants will be interviewed
        about risk factors for EDs. In addition, ages of onset of EDs and comorbid
        conditions, including PTSD, depression, anxiety, and alcohol and substance
        use disorders, will be assessed in order to investigate temporal associations.Our
        findings regarding the prevalence of EDs will help clinicians, researchers,
        and policymakers understand the scope of EDs among Veterans and will also
        aid us in identifying patients for targeted screening or prevention. Identification
        of barriers to care for Veterans with EDs will enable us to address these
        barriers by, for example, providing information to Veterans on the availability
        of services and by addressing stigma. Validating brief screening measures
        for EDs among male and female Veterans will allow us to make recommendations
        to researchers and clinicians who wish to detect EDs efficiently. In the long
        term, screening and identifying vulnerable subgroups, combined with knowledge
        of where Veterans with EDs are seeking services, will allow us to implement
        effective, targeted screening and prevention programs and to intervene early,
        improving treatment outcomes. Identifying military-specific risk/maintenance
        factors for EDs will allow us to implement treatments for EDs that are appropriate
        for Veterans. Addressing comorbidity in evidenced-based treatments is a critical
        issue, and this proposal will provide important foundational work for developing
        treatments and providing them to Veterans with EDs and comorbid mental health
        conditions. Many people with EDs, within Veteran and other populations, do
        not seek or receive treatment for these debilitating conditions. This research
        will be a key contributing step in closing the treatment gap by making it
        possible that patients receive timely treatment in both the community and
        the VA healthcare system.","terms":" Address; Age; Age of Onset; Alcohol consumption;

        The single most important rate limiting step in the process of securing the
        volume of allografts needed to advance the science of vascularized composite
        allotransplantation (VCA) and its therapeutic application is whether individuals
        will be willing to donate vascularized composite allografts in sufficient
        numbers. The ability to obtain family authorization for vascularized composite
        allograft donation is crucial to make the option of VCA available to all in
        need, but it is especially critical to improving care for military personnel
        who suffer catastrophic injuries in Service to the country. Part of this process
        will be educating the public and also, importantly, understanding how requests
        for vascularized composite allograft donation will be made to the family decision-makers
        (FDMs) of solid organ donors.Hypothesis or Objective(s): Our primary objective
        is to increase the number of vascularized composite allografts available for
        transplantation by optimizing authorization for donation among families of
        deceased organ donors. To accomplish this, we propose the formative work needed
        to adapt an existing web-based training for OPO request staff with proven
        effectiveness in increasing family authorization to solid organ and tissue
        donation (Communicating Effectively about Donation [CEaD]) and to beta-test
        the revised program (CEaD-VCA).Specific Aims/Study Design: The aim of the
        proposed study is threefold. First, we will explore the knowledge, attitudes,
        and acceptability of VCA among OPO request staff, families agreeing to the
        donation of solid organs from deceased donor-eligible patients, and the general
        public using two approaches: semi-structured telephone interviews with a nationally
        representative sample of OPO request staff (N=150) and a series of focus groups
        with the general public and a sample of donor families (Aim 1). Second, we
        will adapt the web-based, empirically developed CEaD training program to the
        vascularized composite allograft donation request context (Aim 2). Using the
        results of Aim 1, we will revise the CEaD to address and fill gaps in knowledge
        of VCA and its need, particularly among military personnel, and engender favorable
        attitudes toward vascularized composite allograft donation among both OPO
        request staff and potential organ donor families. Third, we will beta-test
        the potential of the newly-revised CEaD-VCA on OPO requesters’ VCA knowledge
        and attitudes, as well as comfort and confidence discussing the option of
        vascularized composite allograft donation with FDMs who authorize solid organ
        donation (Aim 3). A sample of OPO requesters (N=42) will complete the web-based
        training, and quantitative pre- and post-surveys will capture demographic
        characteristics, as well as validated measures used in the investigators’
        previous studies on organ and tissue donation, modified as appropriate for
        the vascularized composite allograft donation context. Participating requesters’
        behavioral communication skills will be assessed during simulated requests
        for vascularized composite allograft donation with trained actors, a process
        the research team has successfully used in previous intervention studies on
        requests for solid organ donation.Impact: The proposed research will add to
        OPO requesters’ existing skillset, improving the quality of requests and the
        experiences of families approached about the option of organ, tissue, and
        vascularized composite allograft donations. Should the adapted CEaD-VCA prove
        efficacious, it will improve the chances of family authorization of vascularized
        composite allograft donation and increase the number vascularized composite
        allographs available for transplantation.Military Relevance: Twenty-first
        century weaponry has outpaced the available medical technologies needed to
        repair subsequent limb loss, loss of function, and disability suffered through
        Service in active war zones. The “exquisite capabilities” of VCA represent
        a significant step forward in the care of severely wounded Veterans. However,
        neither the public nor providers have the requisite awareness, knowledge,
        or willingness to make VCA a reality for all military personnel with disabling
        and disfiguring wounds. The proposed study will identify barriers and facilitators
        to OPO requesters’ presentation of the option of vascularized composite allografts
        donation to organ donor families and to potential donors’ willingness to authorize

        The single most important rate limiting step in the process of securing the
        volume of allografts needed to advance the science of vascularized composite
        allotransplantation (VCA) and its therapeutic application is whether individuals
        will be willing to donate vascularized composite allografts in sufficient
        numbers. The ability to obtain family authorization for vascularized composite
        allograft donation is crucial to make the option of VCA available to all in
        need, but it is especially critical to improving care for military personnel
        who suffer catastrophic injuries in Service to the country. Part of this process
        will be educating the public and also, importantly, understanding how requests
        for vascularized composite allograft donation will be made to the family decision-makers
        (FDMs) of solid organ donors.Hypothesis or Objective(s): Our primary objective
        is to increase the number of vascularized composite allografts available for
        transplantation by optimizing authorization for donation among families of
        deceased organ donors. To accomplish this, we propose the formative work needed
        to adapt an existing web-based training for Organ Procurement Organization
        (OPO) request staff with proven effectiveness in increasing family authorization
        to solid organ and tissue donation (Communicating Effectively about Donation
        [CEaD]) and to beta-test the revised program (CEaD-VCA).Specific Aims/Study
        Design: The aim of the proposed study is threefold. First, we will explore
        the knowledge, attitudes, and acceptability of VCA among OPO request staff,
        families agreeing to the donation of solid organs from deceased donor-eligible
        patients, and the general public using two approaches: semi-structured telephone
        interviews with a nationally representative sample of OPO request staff (N=150)
        and a series of focus groups with the general public and a sample of donor
        families (Aim 1). Second, we will adapt the web-based, empirically developed
        CEaD training program to the vascularized composite allograft donation request
        context (Aim 2). Using the results of Aim 1, we will revise the CEaD to address
        and fill gaps in knowledge of VCA and its need, particularly among military
        personnel, and engender favorable attitudes toward vascularized composite
        allograft donation among both OPO request staff and potential organ donor
        families. Third, we will beta-test the potential of the newly-revised CEaD-VCA
        on OPO requesters’ VCA knowledge and attitudes, as well as comfort and confidence
        discussing the option of vascularized composite allograft donation with FDMs
        who authorize solid organ donation (Aim 3). A sample of OPO requesters (N=42)
        will complete the web-based training, and quantitative pre- and post-surveys
        will capture demographic characteristics, as well as validated measures used
        in the investigators’ previous studies on organ and tissue donation, modified
        as appropriate for the vascularized composite allograft donation context.
        Participating requesters’ behavioral communication skills will be assessed
        during simulated requests for vascularized composite allograft donation with
        trained actors, a process the research team has successfully used in previous
        intervention studies on requests for solid organ donation.Impact: The proposed
        research will add to OPO requesters’ existing skillset, improving the quality
        of requests and the experiences of families approached about the option of
        organ, tissue, and vascularized composite allograft donations. Should the
        adapted CEaD-VCA prove efficacious, it will improve the chances of family
        authorization of vascularized composite allograft donation and increase the
        number vascularized composite allographs available for transplantation.Military
        Relevance: Twenty-first century weaponry has outpaced the available medical
        technologies needed to repair subsequent limb loss, loss of function, and
        disability suffered through Service in active war zones. The “exquisite capabilities”
        of VCA represent a significant step forward in the care of severely wounded
        Veterans. However, neither the public nor providers have the requisite awareness,
        knowledge, or willingness to make VCA a reality for all military personnel
        with disabling and disfiguring wounds. The proposed study will identify barriers
        and facilitators to OPO requesters’ presentation of the option of vascularized
        composite allografts donation to organ donor families and to potential donors’
        willingness to authorize vascularized composite allograft donation. This study
        will also develop requesters’ capacity to make effective, successful requests
        for vascularized composite allograft donation, a necessary precondition to
        securing enough transplantable allografts to care for severely wounded military
        personnel.","terms":" Address; Allografting; Attitude; Authorization documentation;

        Problem: Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) of the hand/arm
        (hand) is an emerging medical procedure that offers unprecedented potential
        to restore physical functioning, enhance independence, and dramatically improve
        the quality of life (QOL) of individuals who have had an upper-extremity amputation.
        Lack of validated outcomes variables and poorly defined candidate screening
        methods have limited the use of this surgical procedure. The majority of outcomes
        decisions have focused on the physiologic survival of the allotransplant and
        ignored the impacts on QOL for the recipients. While research has documented
        that it is possible to achieve physiologic graft survival, the dearth of psychosocial
        outcomes measures for this population has hindered the ability to compare
        the physical, emotional, and social outcomes of upper-extremity VCA recipients
        to determine the optimal candidate screening approach empirically. It is for
        these reasons that holistic evaluations of VCA outcomes are desperately needed.Objective:
        This study seeks to lay the groundwork for developing validated VCA outcome
        measures by identifying the QOL domains that are most relevant to hand transplantation
        candidates and recipients. This research will create a framework for understanding
        QOL in these individuals that will lead to a condition-specific set of patient-reported
        outcome (PRO) measures that can be used to evaluate holistic VCA outcomes
        and can be incorporated into candidacy determinations. This study will specifically
        evaluate items in the Extremity Trauma and Amputation – Quality of Life (ExTrA-QOL)
        measurement system for their relevance for VCA patients. Finally, this study
        seeks to evaluate and standardize the VCA candidate screening process.Specific
        Aims/Study Design: The specific aims of this proposed project are: (1) to
        determine the psychosocial and QOL domains most important to individuals involved
        in the VCA process; (2) to enhance the selection and validation of standardized,
        psychometrically robust, and clinically useful PRO measures for traits and
        symptoms that are of critical importance to VCA patients; and (3) to optimize
        the VCA candidate screening process by identifying and standardizing the most
        important clinical and psychosocial characteristics to consider for successful
        transplantation.To achieve Aim 1, the research team will conduct focus groups
        (n = 2) with VCA clinicians (n = 12), as well as individual interviews with
        60-65 patients involved in the VCA process. The focus group and interview
        transcripts will be analyzed systematically and thematically to develop a
        qualitative framework for understanding QOL in individuals involved in the
        VCA process. To achieve Aim 2, patient participants will complete a second,
        cognitive debriefing interview to determine which existing ExTrA-QOL items
        are appropriate for individuals involved in the VCA process and/or which new
        items need to be developed. To address Aim 3, the research team will evaluate
        the candidate screening process by conducting interviews with VCA clinicians
        (n = 25) and patients (n = 30). The team will also collect data on the screening
        process and examine the VCA exclusion criteria across the collaborating sites.
        Using mixed-methods (qualitative/quantitative) approaches, the team will evaluate
        the variables and measures currently used for screening and, ultimately, make
        formal recommendations for standardization of the candidate selection process.Impact:
        This project will create a framework for understanding QOL for individuals
        involved in the VCA process and facilitate the development of validated psychosocial
        outcome measures for VCA hand transplantation. This information can be used
        to optimize the VCA candidate screening process, maximize the benefit received
        from each transplant, and increase the overall success of hand transplantation.Military
        Relevance: This project will directly address the needs of combat-wounded
        individuals who are considering VCA and will assist military clinicians in
        making empirically based determinations for recommending individuals post-upper-limb-amputation
        to pursue VCA. In addition, improving clinicians’ awareness of the most important
        issues affecting the QOL of VCA hand transplant candidates and recipients
        will increase standards of care and therefore improve the lives of Service
        members and others who sustain upper limb amputation.","terms":" Address;

        Assistive technology (AT) provides people with physical disabilities, such
        as spinal cord injury (SCI), the ability to compensate for functional limitations.
        Numerous AT systems have been developed to enable individuals with physical
        disabilities to utilize computers and smartphones. AT includes devices/programs
        such as voice recognition software, sip-and-puff devices, mouth sticks, head
        devices, adapted mouse controls, and specialized wrist or arm devices. The
        accessibility of devices to individuals with physical impairments such as
        SCI can be problematic because of financial constraints that limit the ability
        to purchase the devices and/or Internet service as well as functional impairments
        that make controlling the device difficult.Research problem: Although AT,
        specifically computer and smartphone equipment and the hardware and software
        devices that make these more usable, is routinely prescribed for individuals
        with tetraplegia in multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs, evidence regarding
        the impact of AT on function (e.g., employment, community reintegration) and/or
        psychosocial (e.g., self-efficacy, quality of life) outcomes after tetraplegia
        is limited.Specific aims: Aim 1 (Qualitative): To examine perceived barriers
        to facilitators of AT access and utilization and the impact on functional
        and psychosocial outcomes after tetraplegia. No specific hypotheses are proposed
        for this qualitative aim. Aim 2 (Quantitative): To assess for variations in
        use of AT among individuals with tetraplegia across insurance providers and
        socioeconomic status in Veterans and civilians with tetraplegia.Aim 3a (Quantitative):
        To assess the relationship between AT use and productivity (employment/school)
        in Veterans and civilians with tetraplegia. We hypothesize that those who
        have access to and use AT will have higher rates of paid employment than those
        without access to or use of AT. Aim 3b (Quantitative): To assess the relationship
        between AT and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., mood, self-efficacy) in Veterans
        and civilians with tetraplegia. Study design: The proposed study will employ
        a mixed-methods approach to achieve the specific aims. To address Aim 1 and
        develop an in-depth understanding of the barriers and facilitators to AT access
        and utilization, semi-structured focus groups of 5 to 7 participants per group
        will be conducted at a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center
        in the midwestern United States and a private, non-profit rehabilitation hospital
        in the western United States. To address Aims 2, 3a, and 3b, cross-sectional
        data from 150 participants from each of the two study sites will be collected
        via telephone interview. In addition to demographic and injury-related information,
        data will be collected on the psychosocial impact of assistive devices, productivity
        (i.e., employment, school work), mood, self-efficacy, quality of life, perceived
        manageability of needs, and societal participation. Impact: The findings from
        this study are expected to guide the development of future interventions assessing
        the impact of assistive technology on employment, mood, and community integration
        for Veterans with tetraplegia. Additionally, the information generated from
        this study will be critical to inform future policy, clinical practice, and
        reimbursement standards for assistive technology for both Veterans and civilians
        with SCI.Military relevance: There are an estimated 100,000 American Veterans
        with SCI or disease. The incidence of SCI has increased significantly among
        Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom Veterans and is expected
        to continue to rise with modernized combat and the use of unconventional war
        tactics. Veterans with SCI who desire to return to school or the workforce
        will require access to AT. This study will identify barriers that Veterans
        encounter when attempting to gain access to AT and help formulate interventions
        or policy change to enhance access.","terms":" Address; American; arm; Cellular

        disorders (EDs), including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating
        disorder, are pernicious conditions with the highest mortality rate of any
        psychiatric disorder.  They also are extremely impairing, more so than nearly
        any other psychiatric disorder, and individuals with EDs are high users of
        healthcare, given the physical complications of these conditions.  Yet, EDs
        remain understudied among Veterans, possibly due to the misperception that
        members of this population do not suffer from EDs.  Recent findings contradict
        this belief, as studies by the Initiating Principal Investigator have demonstrated
        that both male and female Veterans have rates of EDs that are at least as
        high as, if not higher than, the general U.S. population.  Military and Veteran-specific
        risk/maintenance factors for EDs, such as difficulty conforming to military
        weight and fitness standards and exposure to military sexual trauma and combat,
        may operate together with earlier childhood factors to contribute to the onset
        of EDs.  Thus, Veterans may be particularly vulnerable to EDs.  Veterans with
        EDs are likely to be high users of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare,
        but given the lack of national screening or treatment programs, the ED may
        be undetected.  This proposal will fill crucial gaps in the literature and
        validate screening measures of EDs in post-9/11 Veterans to enable detection
        and early intervention for these debilitating conditions.This application
        focuses on EDs and addresses several Fiscal Year 2017 Peer Reviewed Medical
        Research Program Areas for Encouragement, including prevalence of diagnosable
        EDs and other clinically significant disordered eating, associations between
        ED symptoms and military-unique behaviors and conditions, and treatment patterns
        of individuals with EDs.  We will establish a cohort of post-9/11 Veterans
        who were separated from Service within the past year in order to: (1a) Examine
        the prevalence of full/subthreshold EDs among male and female Veterans.  (1b)
        Examine the proportion of full/subthreshold EDs among vulnerable subgroups
        of Veterans.  (1c) Examine temporal associations among EDs and comorbid disorders,
        including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and
        alcohol and substance use disorders.  (2a) Document treatment patterns and
        healthcare preferences among male and female Veterans with probable full/subthreshold
        ED diagnoses.  (2b) Compare treatment patterns for Veterans with probable
        full/subthreshold ED diagnoses to Veterans without ED diagnoses.  (2c) Identify
        barriers to care for Veterans seeking mental health treatment in general and
        for EDs specifically.  (3) Identify the impact of general and military/Veteran-specific
        risk/maintenance factors for ED symptoms and investigate gender differences.  (4)
        Validate and compare two existing, scalable, screening measures of EDs in
        a Veteran sample.This will be a cross-sectional study.  Participants will
        be randomly selected from the roster of Veterans who separated from Service
        within the past year.  Names will be provided by the VA/Department of Defense
        (DoD) Identity Repository (VADIR), a VA office with access to DoD records.  We
        will recruit a sample of 2100 Veterans to complete a mailed survey.  Survey
        respondents whose scores exceed clinical cutoffs on ED screening measures,
        as well as an age- and sex-matched sample of healthy controls, will be selected
        to participate in a telephone interview.  ED diagnoses will be confirmed,
        and participants will be interviewed about risk factors for EDs.  In addition,
        ages of onset of EDs and comorbid conditions, including PTSD, depression,
        anxiety, and alcohol and substance use disorders, will be assessed in order
        to investigate temporal associations.Our findings regarding the prevalence
        of EDs will help clinicians, researchers, and policymakers understand the
        scope of EDs among Veterans and will also aid us in identifying patients for
        targeted screening or prevention.  Identification of barriers to care for
        Veterans with EDs will enable us to address these barriers by, for example,
        providing information to Veterans on the availability of services and by addressing
        stigma.  Validating brief screening measures for EDs among male and female
        Veterans will allow us to make recommendations to researchers and clinicians
        who wish to detect EDs efficiently.  In the long term, screening and identifying
        vulnerable subgroups, combined with knowledge of where Veterans with EDs are
        seeking services, will allow us to implement effective, targeted screening
        and prevention programs and to intervene early, improving treatment outcomes.  Identifying
        military-specific risk/maintenance factors for EDs will allow us to implement
        treatments for EDs that are appropriate for Veterans.  Addressing comorbidity
        in evidenced-based treatments is a critical issue, and this proposal will
        provide important foundational work for developing treatments and providing
        them to Veterans with EDs and comorbid mental health conditions.  Many people
        with EDs, within Veteran and other populations, do not seek or receive treatment
        for these debilitating conditions.  This research will be a key contributing
        step in closing the treatment gap by making it possible that patients receive
        timely treatment in both the community and the VA healthcare system.","terms":"

        Active surveillance is recommended for men with localized low-risk prostate
        cancer (PC) to prevent ''overtreatment'' and to maintain the patient''s sexual
        and urinary functioning. However, approximately 90% of patients eligible for
        active surveillance opt for curative treatment and 25%-50% of patients on
        active surveillance discontinue the active surveillance protocol within 2-5
        years without clinical evidence for cancer progression. Previous studies showed
        that psychological distress over the uncertainty of the future, or fear of
        losing the opportunity for a cure are significant drivers of discontinuing
        surveillance. To date, no study has provided an intervention to enhance adherence
        to surveillance among PC patients.Objectives/Hypotheses: We propose to adopt
        an efficacious, symptom management intervention [Prostate Cancer Patient Education
        Program (PCPEP)] and assess its feasibility and acceptability to increase
        adherence to active surveillance among men with PC. The care planning intervention
        for prostate cancer patients (CPI-Prostate) on active surveillance consists
        of four modules: (1) education on active surveillance; (2) a care plan for
        the patient and the provider delivered in a paper- and electronic-format (EHRs);
        (3) a 1-hour, navigator-led session with the patient to screen for distress
        and unmet needs and to discuss the care plan; and (4) four navigator-led follow-up
        calls to continue the assessment of distress and unmet needs and to discuss
        changes to the care plan. We hypothesize that (a) the intervention will be
        highly acceptable and feasible. Although the study is not designed to test
        for efficacy, we further hypothesize that (b) study participants will report
        adherence to active surveillance and improved psychosocial outcomes over a
        12-month follow-up period (e.g., low distress levels).Specific Aims: Aim 1:
        To adopt an efficacious, symptom management intervention (PCPEP) for PC patients
        on active surveillance. As part of the adoption process, we will (Aim 1a)
        develop an EHR-based care plan for the patient and the care provider; (Aim
        1b) conduct eight focus groups with patients and stakeholders to examine the
        barriers and facilitators of offering, acceptance of, and adherence to active
        surveillance, and unmet needs; inform the refinement of the CPI-Prostate modules;
        and augment the content and function of the care plan; and (Aim 1c) conduct
        usability testing to establish the usability of the care plan software.Aim
        2: To evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the CPI-Prostate program
        with PC patients on active surveillance in a small pilot study. Study Design:
        Participants will be recruited from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York
        City. Following the completion of the preliminary designs of the CPI-Prostate
        program, and the content and layout of the care plan, eight focus groups (30
        patients and 10 stakeholders; 5 participants per group) will be conducted
        to obtain feedback on barriers, facilitators, unmet needs, and initial designs
        and layout of the care plans (Aims 1a-b). For the usability study (Aim 1c),
        we will conduct usability testing with 10 patients and stakeholders to examine
        the functionality and clarity of a penultimate beta version of the EHR-based
        care plan. All focus groups and interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed,
        and analyzed. Results will be incorporated in the final version of the CPI-Prostate
        program. The finalized program will be examined in a feasibility study (Aim
        2) among 80 PC patients on active surveillance. Following the baseline assessment,
        participants will be invited to attend a 1-hour session with a social worker
        navigator followed by four follow-up calls. Outcome measurements will be administered
        at baseline (before the session) and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter.
        The primary outcomes will be the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention
        and adherence to surveillance. Secondary outcomes will include distress, unmet
        needs, uncertainty, decisional regret, fear of cancer progression, quality
        of life, and satisfaction with care and communication. Descriptive and inferential
        statistical techniques will be used to examine primary outcomes and changes
        in secondary outcomes from baseline to 12 months. Innovation: This is the
        first study to examine an intervention to enhance adherence to active surveillance
        among PC patients. The use of EHRs in delivering follow-up care plans is also
        novel.Impact: The study addresses an important and serious challenge in PC
        management. The planned intervention will reduce barriers to active surveillance,
        thereby improving patients'' adjustment and quality of life. The potential
        for dissemination in the clinic by existing navigator staff is high. Overarching
        Challenges and Focus Areas: The proposed application is responsive to the
        Prostate Cancer Research Program Idea Development Award (PCRP PDA) goals as:
        (1) it represents an innovative approach to improve care planning for men
        on active surveillance; (2) it examines unmet needs and barriers to active
        surveillance, and proposes a novel intervention to meet those needs and to
        address those barriers; and (3) it is conducted by a multidisciplinary and
        synergistic team of investigators. The study further meets one of the PCRP
        IDA overarching challenges of developing strategies to optimize the physical
        and mental health of men with PC. Finally, the application fits in the PCRP
        IDA focus area of survivorship as it offers an intervention designed to improve
        the well-being and quality of life of survivors and their families.","terms":"

        an estimated 238,000 cases of ovarian cancer occur each year and almost 152,000
        women die from the disease. Canada and the United States are among the countries
        with the highest incidence rates, and in both countries it is the fifth leading
        cause of cancer death. Ideally, ovarian cancer would be controlled through
        public health efforts aimed at primary prevention, but the etiology is poorly
        understood and known preventive factors, such as oral contraceptives or tubal
        ligation, cannot be recommended at the population level. Secondary prevention
        directed towards early diagnosis could greatly improve ovarian cancer prognosis;
        however, due to a lack of a defined preinvasive phase, population-based screening
        for ovarian cancer is not currently feasible.While further research on primary
        and secondary prevention of ovarian cancer is clearly needed, the research
        gap in tertiary prevention needs to be recognized. Currently, the only factors
        that have been found to potentially influence ovarian cancer prognosis are
        non-modifiable and include: age at diagnosis, stage, debulking status, tumor
        histology and grade. However, cancer patients are more often asking their
        healthcare providers what they themselves can change in their lifestyles to
        influence their prognosis. There are currently no published studies examining
        post-treatment lifestyle factors in relation to ovarian cancer prognosis.
        However, results from a few studies on the role of pre-diagnostic lifestyle
        factors in ovarian cancer survival, as well as findings from studies of prognosis
        of other cancers are promising for a role of lifestyle factors. While the
        majority of women with incident ovarian cancer will experience remission following
        treatment, recurrence of disease will occur for the vast majority. Finding
        ways to prevent recurrence is of great importance in reducing the morbidity
        and mortality associated with this deadly disease. The objective of this study
        is to investigate the role of post-diagnosis lifestyle factors in relation
        to ovarian cancer prognosis. Specifically, the aims are to evaluate associations
        between ovarian cancer recurrence and of each of the following: (1) physical
        activity, (2) healthy diet, (3) vitamin D exposure, (4) smoking, and (5) alcohol
        intake. A second objective is to utilize the data collected to estimate the
        prevalence of participation in healthy post-diagnosis lifestyle behaviors,
        which has not been previously described in ovarian cancer patients. A prospective
        cohort study of ovarian cancer patients will be conducted in Montreal during
        2015 to 2017. Women diagnosed with ovarian cancer during the study period
        at the three Montreal hospital centers with specialized units in gynecologic
        oncology will be recruited. The case recruitment infrastructure built for
        an ongoing case-control study on the etiology of ovarian cancer, being conducted
        by members of this research team, will be used, thus allowing for maximal
        feasibility in implementing the proposed study. A telephone interview assessing
        physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, vitamin D exposures, and demographic
        variables will be conducted at baseline (2 months after treatment) and at
        4 months after baseline. Diet will be assessed using the self-administered
        Canadian Diet History Questionnaire II. The outcome of interest in this study
        is ovarian cancer recurrence. Participants will be followed up via chart reviews.
        Time to recurrence will be calculated from baseline to the date of recurrence.
        Cox proportional hazards models will be used to calculate hazards ratios and
        95% confidence intervals for both continuous and categorical representations
        of exposures.This highly innovative study will be among the first to collect
        lifestyle information at multiple points after diagnosis of ovarian cancer
        and will provide critical initial data on whether modifiable factors can influence
        patient outcome. Overall, this study focuses on a set of lifestyle factors
        in relation to ovarian cancer prognosis that are novel, given the scarcity
        of research on lifestyle and ovarian cancer prognosis.The major short-term
        impact of the study is that data on the prevalence of participation in healthy
        post-diagnosis lifestyle behaviors will be generated, which has not been previously
        described in ovarian cancer patients. These data will allow us to consider
        the feasibility among ovarian cancer patients of adopting (or maintaining)
        favorable lifestyle behaviors. For instance, if the prevalence is very low,
        the factor may not lend itself easily as a clinical recommendation to improve
        prognosis. We will also explore associations with quality of life. Although
        the majority of ovarian cancer patients experience remission, recurrence is
        common, thus knowing how to improve quality of life is of great importance.
        A more long-term impact is that the observed hypothesized associations will
        shed insight on the directionality and magnitude of the associations between
        lifestyle factors and ovarian cancer prognosis. This knowledge can set the
        direction for future studies and inform decisions to expand approaches to
        ovarian cancer care to include recommendations for lifestyle changes. The
        establishment of this cohort of ovarian cancer patients and infrastructure
        will allow for future funding opportunities to be pursued in order to conduct
        a larger more definitive study. Ultimately, the findings will empower women
        affected by ovarian cancer to take control of their health and improve their
        prognosis.","terms":" Adopted; Affect; Aftercare; Age; Alcohol consumption;

        surveillance (AS) is recommended for men with localized low-risk prostate
        cancer (PCa) to prevent ''overtreatment'' and to maintain the patient’s sexual
        and urinary functioning.  However, not all eligible patients equally benefit
        from AS.  Recent studies revealed significant racial disparity in the uptake,
        intensity, and frequency of AS.  Such disparity may lead to a lost opportunity
        for improving survivorship quality in minority men, higher healthcare costs,
        and increased risks of cancer progression due to non-adherent behavior to
        AS in ethnic minority men.  Our current research (PC140612; Principal Investigator:
        Mohamed) showed significant influences of intimate relationship partners’
        involvement on patients’ AS decision.  Here, we propose to examine racial,
        cultural, and dyadic relationship factors that influence minority men’s and
        their partners’ decisions about AS, adherence to AS, and their emotional adjustment,
        coping, and quality of life.Objectives/Hypotheses:  Guided by an integrative
        model of behavioral prediction based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)
        and the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM), literature reviews, and
        our current work on AS patients, and with input from experts (i.e., urologists,
        social workers, psychologists), racial, cultural, and dyadic (i.e., patient-partner)
        influential factors (e.g., age, race, sexual orientation, and partner’s attitudes
        towards AS) that might affect their decisions, adherence to AS, and adjustment
        will be explored, identified, and confirmed using mixed-method qualitative
        and quantitative analyses.  The study aims are:Aim 1 (Phase 1):  To conduct
        focus groups with black and Hispanic PCa patients currently on or discontinued
        AS and their intimate relationship partners to explore their racial, cultural,
        and dyadic relationships factors that influenced their decisions about and
        adherence to AS.  We will conduct 12 focus groups with patients and their
        partners to examine: (a) patients’ and partners’ PCa informational and supportive
        care needs, (b) patients’ and partners’ cultural beliefs and their salient
        beliefs and expectations about AS, and (c) (dis)agreement between patients
        and partners in salient beliefs about AS and how it affects their adherence
        to AS follow-up care.  Focus groups’ outcomes will guide the design of culture-sensitive
        measures to assess theory-based predictors (e.g., attitude, salient beliefs,
        and perceived control) and emerging issues.Aim 2 (Phase 2):  To conduct surveys
        to assess predictors of dyadic decisions about AS, adherence to AS protocol,
        and dyadic emotional adjustment, coping, and quality of life.  We will conduct
        surveys to examine: (a) the effect of patient’s and partner’s race, sexual
        orientation, cultural beliefs, and relationship factors on their attitudes
        towards and decisions about AS; (b) (dis)agreement (i.e., minimization, congruence,
        maximization) between patients and partners in their attitudes towards, salient
        beliefs about, and decisions to opt for AS; and (c) how their (dis)agreement
        influences patients’ adherence to AS follow-up protocol, and their emotional
        adjustment, coping, and quality of life.  These proposed analyses will be
        conducted to identify unique effects of patient and partner predictors of
        decisions and adherence to AS with the goal to inform the selections of different
        components for future culture-sensitive, dyadic, and triadic (patient-partner-provider)
        decision-making interventions and communication training programs for PCa
        clinicians.Study Design:  Participants will be recruited from four sites in
        New York: the Mount Sinai Health System, University Hospital of Brooklyn,
        Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, and James J. Peters VA Medical Center.  All
        focus groups and interviews (Phase 1) will be audio-recorded, transcribed,
        and analyzed.  Results will be incorporated in the final version of the surveys
        (Phase 2).  The surveys will be conducted at baseline (i.e., following diagnosis),
        6-week, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months thereafter.  We will include newly diagnosed
        PCa patients and partners (N = 470 couples) making PCa treatment decisions
        at baseline and 6-week assessments to examine predictors of AS decisions and
        (dis)agreement in AS decisions.  The follow-up assessment will include only
        dyads who opt for AS (N = 188 couples) to examine distal and proximal predictors
        of adherence to AS and how (dis)agreement between patient and partner influence
        adherence, emotional adjustment, coping, and quality of life.  We will conduct
        exit interviews at the 12-month assessment and when decisions to discontinue
        AS are made during the study period to qualitatively explore reasons for discontinuation.  Descriptive
        and inferential statistical techniques will be used to examine dyadic predictors
        of AS decisions, adherence, and adjustment.Innovation:  This is the first
        prospective and longitudinal study to examine racial, cultural, and dyadic
        factors affecting AS decision and adherence.  The use of an integrative model
        of behavioral prediction to guide the study design is novel.  Impact:  The
        study addresses an important and serious challenge in PCa management in minority
        patients.  Study results will reduce barriers to AS, thereby improving minority
        patients’ and their partners’ adjustment and quality of life.  The potential
        for dissemination of study-designed culture-sensitive measures to assist with
        the AS decision in PCa research and clinical consultations is high.  Overarching
        Challenges and Focus Areas:  This application is responsive to the Prostate
        Cancer Research Program Health Disparity Research Award goals as it: (1) fills
        an obvious void in our knowledge about the cultural, racial, and dyadic factors
        that contribute to patients’ decisions about PCa treatment and follow-up care;
        (2) will provide valuable information on how to optimize the quality of life
        of patients and their partners, and how to augment patient-partner-physician
        communication about AS; and (3) is conducted by a multidisciplinary and synergistic
        team of investigators.  The study further meets one of the overarching challenges
        of developing strategies to optimize the physical and mental health of minority
        men with PCa and their partners.  Finally, the application fits in the focus
        area of survivorship as it aims to improve understanding of PCa patients’
        and partners’ unmet needs and racial, cultural, and dyadic factors that can
        influence their well-being and quality of life.","terms":" Address; Adherence;

        7 percent of the nearly 700,000 military personnel who served in the 1991
        Gulf War were women.  Multiple studies have looked at rates of Gulf War illness
        (GWI) in female vs. male Gulf War (GW) Veterans, and several have assessed
        psychiatric issues that differ by gender in this population.  Results from
        some studies but not all suggest that GWI is more common in women GW Veterans
        than their male counterparts.  However, in the 25 years since the war, few
        studies have evaluated GWI and other medical conditions specifically as they
        affect women Veterans of the 1991 Gulf War.  A small number of studies suggested
        excess rates of women''s health problems, e.g., breast cysts, abnormal Pap
        smears, yeast infections, and bladder infections.  Several studies have identified
        significantly elevated rates of birth defects and adverse reproductive outcomes
        among GW Veterans.  Overall, however, findings have varied with different
        study designs and sample sizes, with some studies showing elevated risks of
        stillbirths, miscarriages, and/or birth defects.  Increased risks of ectopic
        pregnancies and spontaneous abortions have been observed in some studies.  There
        remains a need to evaluate birth outcomes in appropriate subgroups, e.g.,
        by time period of birth, by parental exposures, and by other deployment characteristics.Objective/Hypothesis:  The
        objectives are: (1) To establish the Gulf War Women''s Cohort (GWWC), a large
        sample of women Veterans who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War and a comparison
        group of women who served in other locations during that period.  (2) To provide
        current, comprehensive data on the health status of women who served during
        the 1990-1991 Gulf War, and identify any specific conditions that affect GW
        women Veterans at excess rates.Specific Aims:  The specific aims are: (1)
        To assemble the GWWC from data collected from women Veterans who participated
        in previous and ongoing population studies of GW era Veterans.  (2) To conduct
        a multimodal health survey to provide data on the current health status of
        women who served during the 1991 GW era and comparisons between GW deployed
        Veterans and non-deployed GW era Veterans. (3) To provide comprehensive data
        on Veteran-reported pregnancy and birth outcomes among GW and GW era women
        Veterans. (4) To evaluate GWI and other high interest health outcomes in women
        Veteran subgroups, including subgroups identified by (i) deployment characteristics
        (e.g., location, exposures, branch of service), and (ii) age and menopausal
        status (e.g., pre-, peri-, and post-menopause subgroups).  (5) Where possible,
        to provide longitudinal assessment of changes in GW era women Veterans'' health
        over time, using baseline data collected in the original population studies
        from which the current cohort sample is drawn.  (6) To examine sex differences
        in GWI including female to male differences in the frequency of symptoms associated
        with GWI and the overall prevalence of GWI among GW female and male Veterans.  Health
        outcomes to be evaluated in the survey include: (a) frequency and patterns
        of Veteran-reported chronic symptoms and medical conditions diagnosed by healthcare
        providers; (b) prevalence of GWI, defined by both the Centers for Disease
        Control and Prevention (CDC) and Kansas criteria; (c) prevalence of female-specific
        health symptoms and medical conditions; and (d) general health and functional
        status, use of healthcare services, hospitalizations.Study Design:  The proposed
        epidemiologic study will utilize both existing datasets and newly collected
        survey data to examine the prevalence and patterns of GWI symptoms, diagnosed
        medical conditions, reproductive health, birth outcomes, and other health
        issues among women who served during the Gulf War.  The proposed study will
        utilize data from multiple studies in order to establish a GWWC.  In studies
        for which it is feasible to re-contact subjects, current data will be collected
        on women''s symptoms and medical conditions and adverse reproductive outcomes
        (still births, ectopic pregnancies, birth defects), using postal survey questionnaires
        and telephone interviews.  In this new data collection, the projected number
        of completed surveys is 450.  Re-analyses of existing data will focus on health
        outcomes specifically affecting women.  Female to male differences in GWI
        will be examined to determine whether GWI manifests differently in women.  Taken
        overall, the minimum sample size expected is 7,898 Veterans.  The number of
        women who will be included in the study is anticipated to be 955-1,420 women
        GW Veterans and an additional 680-854 women Veterans who were not deployed.  This
        includes the estimated 450 women from whom new survey data will be collected.Impact:  The
        project will provide a comprehensive picture of the health of women GW Veterans.  This
        includes assessment of current health status, changes in health symptoms and
        conditions over time, and possible differences in health outcomes associated
        with specific experiences and exposures during the war.  It will allow for
        an assessment of GWI symptom patterns that may be specific to women Veterans
        and a determination of diagnosed medical conditions.  The study will generate
        data that will improve our understanding of GWI in women Veterans who served
        in the Gulf War, women GW Veterans'' health, and adverse reproductive outcomes.","terms":"

        Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a common complication of traumatic brain
        injury (TBI), occurring in up to 20% of civilian patients and as many as 50%
        of military Service members who suffer severe brain trauma, and 3%-5% of those
        who suffer moderate TBI. Epilepsy resulting from brain trauma is often difficult
        to control with medical therapy and is the cause of epilepsy in approximately
        5% of patients referred to specialized epilepsy centers. PTE can be the result
        of TBI of any severity, although the risk is much higher from severe TBI.
        PTE can arise through a variety of mechanisms, which may co-exist within a
        single patient. The clinical, neurophysiologic, and imaging features of epileptogenicity
        differ between these alternate mechanisms, and it is likely that a sophisticated
        understanding of the subtypes of epilepsy resulting from brain trauma will
        be required to successfully develop anti-epileptogenic therapies.Hypotheses:Primary
        Hypothesis (1): PTE is independently associated with negative TBI outcomes,
        such as memory problems, depression, and sleep disorders, compared with subjects
        with comparable TBI without PTE.Secondary Hypothesis (2): Control of post-traumatic
        seizures (with or without anti-epileptic medications) is associated with improvement
        in outcomes after TBI, such as memory problems, depression, and sleep disorders,
        compared with PTE subjects with TBI of similar severity whose seizures do
        not become controlled.Secondary Hypothesis (3): Disruption of thalamo-cortical
        and hippocampal connections, assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) magnetic
        resonance imaging (MRI), is associated with increased risk of PTE after TBI.Exploratory
        Hypothesis (4): Blood biomarkers of neural injury and neuroinflammation, including
        GFAP, UCHL1, tau, neurofilament light chain (NF-L) and pro-inflammatory cytokines
        (e.g., interleukin [IL]-1ß, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), measured
        early after injury, are associated with increased risk of PTE.Specific Aims:Specific
        Aim 1: Extend follow-up period of TRACK-TBI (Transforming Research and Clinical
        Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury) participants from 1 to 5 years. The extensive
        clinical, imaging, and biomarker data that have already been collected in
        these subjects will be leveraged to identify risk factors, comorbidities,
        and prognostic biomarkers of PTE.Specific Aim 2: Extend follow-up period of
        the TRACK-TBI affiliated studies SD-2, from 6 months to 2 years.TRACK-TBI
        EPI will extend follow-up of these severe TBI patients through 2 years after
        injury, identifying over 75% of those who eventually will develop PTE.Specific
        Aim 3: To conduct specialist epileptologist evaluation for all TBI patients
        who screen positive for PTE. Participants who answer yes to screening questions
        for PTE will be invited for in-person evaluations by expert epileptologist
        at each sites. Epilepsy Clinic visits will include an outpatient EEG (electroencephalogram).
        We will also assess functional and neuropsychological outcome at 6, 12, 24,
        and 60 months after injury. A subset of patients from each parent study who
        do not screen positive for PTE, matched by age, gender, and injury characteristics,
        will also be invited for an in-person evaluation.Specific Aim 4: To measure
        candidate blood biomarkers to determine if they are prognostic for epileptogenesis.
        We will used existing blood samples collected from current participants in
        TRACK-TBI. We will measure specific molecular biomarkers of neural injury
        and neuroinflammation/autoimmunity (35-36) using highly sensitive multiplexed
        immunoassays. Serum samples at 1 day, 14 days, 6 months, 12 months after injury
        will be used.Research Strategy: We propose to extend the follow-up (FU) period
        of TRACK-TBI participants from the current 1 year post-injury to 5 years post-injury
        (Aim 1). This will allow identification of >90% of participants who will eventually
        develop PTE. The FU will be done through a structured telephone interview,
        which will include screening questions for PTE, as well as obtain other self-reported
        outcome measures and symptom scales. The FU period for SD-2 participants will
        be extended from the current 6 months post-injury to 2 years post-injury (Aim
        2), using the same structured telephone interview. This will allow identification
        of 75% of subjects who will eventually develop PTE. Participants who screen
        as possible PTE will be invited for an in-depth clinical evaluation with an
        epileptologist at each site (Aim 3), which will be conducted in-person. TRACK-TBI
        has enrolled 2722 subjects with TBI from 2/2014 – 7/2018, and SD-2 started
        enrolling subjects in 2017. Since only half of PTE presents within 1 year
        of injury, the current FU period is insufficient to identify the majority
        of TBI subjects who will ultimately develop PTE.","terms":" Age; Antiepileptic

        Use of an upper limb prosthesis can improve function and quality of life,
        but these devices are frequently abandoned or used only intermittently. Two
        critical reasons for abandonment identified by prosthesis rejecters are insufficient
        prosthesis functionality and insufficient sensory feedback. Living with major
        limb loss is a complex experience involving multiple physical, psychological,
        and social factors. While many studies have investigated the needs and design
        priorities of prosthesis users, few have investigated how prosthesis features
        interact with other psychosocial aspects of the prosthesis use experience
        and overall attitude towards or acceptance of the device (outcome acceptance).
        To provide better prosthetic device options and improve rehabilitation outcomes,
        we must understand the relationships between prosthesis functional and sensory
        capabilities, the subjective experience of the prosthesis, and outcome acceptance
        following limb loss.Objective: Our goal is to understand the critical factors
        associated with outcome acceptance following upper limb loss. We aim to develop
        a unified theoretical model that describes the psychosocial experience of
        upper limb prosthesis use and predicts outcome acceptance following upper
        limb loss. This conceptual framework will enable clinicians and researchers
        to evaluate and predict patient outcomes following limb loss, and to design
        interventions that improve outcomes.Specific Aims:• Specific Aim 1: Assess
        the impact of the experience of prosthesis dexterity and control on outcome
        acceptance.• Specific Aim 2: Assess the impact of sensory feedback experience
        on outcome acceptance.• Specific Aim 3: Refine the theoretical model derived
        from qualitative analyses by exploring the quantitative relationships between
        aspects of the model of outcome acceptance.Hypotheses: Qualitative analyses
        will yield a theoretical model of outcome acceptance that includes psychosocial
        factors and prosthetic device factors related to dexterity, control, and sensory
        feedback. We hypothesize that experiences of prosthesis dexterity, control,
        and sensory feedback will both directly influence and modulate psychosocial
        factors of prosthesis use and user attitudes. We hypothesize that quantitative
        data collected through survey research will triangulate findings from the
        qualitative analyses, confirm the directionality of the conceptual relationships,
        and predict the relative weightings of relationships.Study Design: The proposed
        study is a mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) study using an observational
        design. The qualitative component of the study will involve data collection
        through telephone interviews with 27 participants and analyses using a grounded
        theory approach with constant comparison methods. The quantitative component
        involves administration and analyses of standardized measures quantifying
        constructs of the theoretical model in 120 participants, and use of these
        measures in a structural equation model of outcome acceptance. Participants
        will include persons with unilateral acquired upper limb loss at the transradial
        or transhumeral level who use currently available prosthetic devices.Military
        Benefit and Impact: This study will help researchers and clinicians better
        understand the complex experience of upper limb prosthesis use and how prosthesis
        design features of dexterity, control, and sensory feedback interact with
        other psychosocial factors related to outcome acceptance. The conceptual model
        will aid clinicians in choosing optimal rehabilitation strategies and prosthetics
        options, so that Service members, Veterans, and civilians with limb loss receive
        care and devices that better meet their needs. This may enhance patient attitudes,
        prosthesis satisfaction, and long-term clinical outcomes. This conceptual
        framework will also enable researchers to design more impactful studies, accelerating
        future discoveries and technology development. The information gained in this
        study will guide future prosthesis design priorities by demonstrating which
        factors drive outcome acceptance. Prosthetic devices in the future will thus
        better meet patient needs, which will improve patient quality of life and
        decrease physical and psychological comorbidities of limb loss.","terms":"

        Jersey is the most densely populated and highly urbanized state in the Nation,
        but simultaneously possesses a rich farming history and a long track record
        of progressive policy to sustain a vibrant agricultural industry. For these
        reasons, the State is a natural laboratory for policy research and scholarly
        work on agricultural retention and development. The agriculture industry has
        historically been a strategic focal point for federal land grant system programming
        and its competitiveness in a dynamic global environment remains a national
        priority. Proposed herein is a program of applied research and extension programming
        advancing the NJAES mission ''to enhance the vitality, health, sustainability
        and overall quality of life in New Jersey by developing and delivering practical,
        effective solutions to current and future challenges to agriculture...'' Two
        primary programmatic foci will be:(1) conducting empirical research that evaluates
        progress, outcomes and issues associated with the state&#39;s purchase of
        development rights (PDR) program (established in 1983 under the Agriculture
        Retention and Development Act); and,(2) evaluating agricultural industry development
        opportunities and farmer needs associated with farm-based recreational and
        educational activities (''agritourism'').New Jersey serves as the geographic
        context for much of this proposed research and associated educational outreach.
        However, due to the State&#39;s position as a vanguard for issues related
        to the interplay between agriculture and suburban growth, lessons learned
        here have applicability nationally as boundaries between agricultural production
        areas and suburban growth continue to be redefined. This program of research

        organic producers from Northeastern United States pasture their cows from
        May to mid-October, they begin to supplement with conserved forage in the
        fall. As a result, most organic dairies fed conserved feeds (e.g., silage,
        haylage, and baleage) for approximately seven months over the year raising
        farm costs. Purchased feeds including forage and grains accounted for approximately
        36% of the total cash expenses of organic dairy farms located in Maine and
        Vermont. It is important to note that purchased grains contributed for 90%
        of the total feed costs of these farms. Because conserved forage has lower
        nutritional value compared to good quality pasture, winter feeding costs generally
        increase in response to more grain supplementation to maintain milk production.
        Research is crucial to help reduce winter feeding costs in organic dairy herds.
        Specifically, research must be conducted to help organic and conventional
        dairy farmers make informed decisions about the use of alternative protein
        supplements such as flaxseed meal, field peas, and canola meal. It is hypothesized
        that these alternative protein sources can entirely replace soybean meal in
        dairy diets without compromise milk production and composition and N efficiency
        when fed to lactating dairy cows. A survey of 987 dairy farms across the Northeast
        revealed that 13% of dairy farmers use rotational grazing, 7% use large, modern
        confinement systems (no grazing) with &gt;300 cows, and 80% use a combination
        of low-intensity grazing and traditional confinement with a herd size &lt;300
        cows. We learned through focus group interviews (n = 35 farmers) and surveys
        (n = 143 respondents) that profitable strategies to maximize forage production
        are challenging to 75% Northeastern dairy farmers using rotational grazing.
        Traditional and grazing dairy farms feed higher forage diets than modern confinement
        dairies, and consequently they share similar concerns about how to maximize
        forage production year-round. Therefore, opportunities exist to develop resilient
        alternative forage crops systems (e.g., warm and cool season grasses, summer
        annuals, brassicas) that provide supplemental forage for grazing and/or silage
        feeding during periods of limited biomass production (e.g., early spring,
        the ''summer slump'', and late fall). However, despite the rapidly growing
        interest and adoption of alternative forage crops across the Northeast, research
        data are lacking to help farmers make informed decisions regarding which alternative
        forage crops and rotations maximize animal production, farm profitability,
        and ecosystem services (e.g., carbon and nitrogen sequestration, soil health,
        weed control, etc.) in their enterprises. It is hypothesize that alternative
        forage crops can improve the economic and environmental sustainability of
        organic and conventional dairy farms by mitigating supplemental grain costs
        and whole-farm greenhouse gas emissions per unit of land and milk output through
        enhanced forage intake and soil carbon:nitrogen ratio.","terms":" Accounting;

        illness is an important public health issue in the United States. Data collected
        by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#39;s (CDC) reveal a total
        of 19,056 cases of culture-confirmed bacterial and laboratory-confirmed parasitic
        infection, 4,200 hospitalizations, and 80 deaths among 48 million residents
        of 10 states, 15% of the US population. Some groups such as pregnant women
        are at higher risk for foodborne illness than others. Pregnant women have
        a greater risk for foodborne illness, due to down-regulation of the cellular
        immune system induced by hormonal changes. A growing body of research on low-income
        pregnant women as a whole, however, very little records on minority ethnic
        and cultural factors.Each minority group has their unique food culture, thus,
        they encounter some different barriers to food safety recommendations. First,
        different ethnicity tends to have their own selection of dishes that require
        precautions and special preparation methods to enhance food safety: the Latin
        Americans that have raw seafood in their Ceviche, the Vietnamese that have
        raw meat in pho, and the Japanese, whose sushi chefs need to frequently change
        the water bowls that they use to keep their hands wet during sushi preparation.
        It has also been reported that Asian and Mexican families were particularly
        more willing to purchase live poultry, which has not yet been studied in a
        food safety perspective, but could put them at greater risk of cross-contamination.
        Secondly, some ethnic foods have been reported being related to foodborne
        illness outbreaks. Hispanic pregnant women tended to have a higher incidence
        of Listeriosis, which was associated with their consumption of Mexican-style
        fresh cheese. Similarly, high incidence of Yersinia among African American
        was related to the seasonal production of chitterlings. Fifty percent of outbreaks
        between 1990 and 2000 associated with Asian foods were due to B. cereus, which
        is reported to be transmitted from rice, a common ingredient in Asian dishes.
        This may be related to different perception of food safety in different cultures.
        It is reported that Asian scored significantly lower on food safety awareness,
        self-assessment. This project will utilize an integrated approach to address
        food safety, and develop educational programs based on positive deviance theory.
        The positive deviance food safety curriculum, a novel educational intervention,
        allows participants to discuss their food handling behaviors under the direction
        of a trained moderator and decide to try recommended practices modeled by
        peers like themselves The project will focus on understanding of the attitudes
        and behaviors of safe food handling and safe food choice among low-income
        minority pregnant women (African American, Hispanic and Asian), and evaluating
        and implementing culturally tailored strategies to overcome barriers to food
        safety practices. The following objectives will be met: 1) assess attitudes,
        awareness, and behaviors of food handling and food choice among low-income
        African American, Hispanic and Asian pregnant women; 2) Modify education program
        to address each ethnic group&#39;s unique food culture, and evaluate the effectiveness
        of culturally tailored Positive Deviance food safety curricula among low-income
        African American, Hispanic and Asian pregnant women; 3) Collaborate with local
        WIC program, Cooperative Extension Educators, and Health Professionals to
        promote the curricula among low-income minority pregnant women. This mixed-methods
        study partners with local health education organizations and uses focus groups,
        interviews, and intercepts surveys to provide insight applicable to other
        food safety education areas. The ultimate goal is to enhance safe food handling
        and safe food choice among low-income minority pregnant women, and will shed
        lights in an understanding of low-income family&#39;s unique barriers to safe
        food handling and food culture.","terms":" Address; African American; Area;

        are many strategies on how to increase the academic achievement for children
        from low-income families. Arguably good teaching will produce good results.
        However, multicultural researchers contend that providing culturally affirming
        teaching practices develops children who see themselves as cultural workers
        and leaders. These practices, in turn, reverse the current trend of low performance
        among these groups once they enter primary school. Children today live in
        communities that reflect the diversity of our American society. They interact
        with other families and children who are from different cultures, speak different
        languages, or may have a special need or exceptionality. Children also see
        images of diversity (positive and negative) each day in books, toys, and cartoon
        characters. When you consider how diversity in gender, ability, language,
        culture, ethnicity is all around us, it is not unexpected that young children,
        are very curious and excited about learning from the diverse world and people
        around them. This project explores how teachers and parents help to support
        young children&#39;s social and cultural development and awareness. The primary
        goal is to create opportunities for children from low income and culturally
        diverse backgrounds to grow and thrive in a responsive, stimulating and affirmative
        educational and home environment. The lead investigator will use a muti-case
        study approach to capture the authentic experiences of the children, families
        and teachers who will participate in this project. Data will be collected
        from a variety of sources such as individual and group interviews, community
        and classroom observations, and early childhood classroom observational measures.
        The findings from this multi-case study will be used to create research informed
        resources and programs for teachers and families of culturally and linguistically
        diverse young children.The ultimate impact of this project will be that the
        early childhood professionals and parents of young children, will have the
        knowledge, skills and resources to create affirming, stimulating and high
        quality learning environments for the children in their care. Also, by proactively
        and intentionally targeting these children when they are young, pre-school
        readiness is maximized and the achievement gap in later elementary years minimized.","terms":"

        compared to studies on parent-adolescent and peer relationships, siblings
        rarely have been studied as agents of socialization for youth. There are several
        areas that require further examination. First, we know little about the direct
        mechanisms by which siblings are influential on adolescents&#39; development.
        Second, although we do know that older siblings&#39; risky behavior involvement
        is an important predictor of adolescents&#39; own risky behavior involvement
        (e.g., sexual behaviors, delinquency), we have little knowledge of how older
        siblings are influential on their younger brothers&#39; and sisters&#39; positive
        development (e.g., physical activity, school achievement, moral development,
        volunteerism, prosocial behaviors). Third, for the most part, the research
        has focused on siblings in European American families and only recently attention
        has been paid to siblings from families of other racial and ethnic groups.

        recent years, the role of entrepreneurship as a catalyst for economic growth
        and as a firm strategy for addressing the complex issues and problems facing
        today&#39;s decision-makers has attracted considerable interest. While issues
        of growth and complexity are shared throughout the economy, the motives for
        fostering entrepreneurship hold particular relevance for the Michigan agri-food
        economy, and more broadly for the global agri-food economy as well. The objective
        of this study is, therefore, to identify strategies for enhancing the profitability
        and sustainability of agri-food firms through entrepreneurship, and indirectly
        to stimulate rural economic development.This project will engage directly
        with agri-food entrepreneurs and firms to evaluate the effectiveness of various
        entrepreneurial assistance programs, alternative business models, and management
        practices that may be adopted. Data will be collected from key firm and industry
        stakeholders (via focus groups, interviews and surveys) to generate new knowledge
        through case study and empirical analysis. This new knowledge will be shared
        with target audiences through workshops, teaching curriculum, and industry
        and academic reports. It is the intention that this knowledge will inform

        a OREI funded planning grant our multidisciplinary team conducted focus group
        interviews, seminars, and organic dairy visits, and we concluded that organic
        dairy producers in the Upper Midwest seek to enhance forage production, increase
        milk production, and improve animal health to remain viable in the dairy industry.
        The present proposal addresses all three of these challenges through research
        involving the University of Minnesota''s West Central Research and Outreach
        Center''s certified organic dairy and cooperating organic dairy farms in the
        region. The overarching goal of our project is to enhance the profitability
        of organic dairy herds in the Upper Midwest through developing best management
        practices using a systems approach. We will develop methods to increase organic
        pasture productivity, improve cow health and well-being through winter housing
        and pasture fly management, and increase the profit of organic dairy herds
        through improved milk quality. Our stakeholder group of organic farmers helped
        identify and develop the objectives included in this proposal; and they will
        provide leadership for coordinated on-farm field research and sites for field
        days. The results of this project will be valuable to organic dairy producers,
        and will be disseminated to organic producers and industry representatives
        throughout the United States. Our research results will be shared with our
        larger stakeholder groups through field days, conferences, publications, and
        webinars. Use of eOrganic will allow stakeholders to review the progress of
        the work and discuss important issues related to organic agriculture with
        researchers and one another on a continuing basis.","terms":" Address; Agriculture;

        about two out of five births now occurring outside of marriage, a growing
        share of single parent families are headed by unmarried mothers. A large body
        of research has shown that children living in single parent families are more
        likely to experience poverty than other children and are at higher risk for
        a number of additional challenges as teens and young adults. Although children
        in single parent households are now the focus of considerable policy attention
        in New York and elsewhere, surprisingly little research has examined how economically
        disadvantaged families make decisions around child custody, particularly in
        situations where parents were never married to each other. This project will
        use literature reviews, statistical analysis, focus groups, and interviews
        to explore several basic questions related to custody decisions in families
        headed by unmarried parents. In particular, the project will examine how families
        make decisions about where the child will reside and how much time they will
        spend with the noncustodial parent and other caregivers; how these decisions
        correspond with the best interest of child standard and other legal statues
        related to child custody; why families may chose to establish informal vs.
        formal custody agreements through the courts; and, the implications of these
        decisions for their program eligibility and legal rights and responsibilities.
        A disproportionate number of nonmarital births in the U.S. occur to African
        American and Latina women and women at lower educational levels. As such,
        research on child custody decisions among unmarried parents will be particularly
        relevant for economically disadvantaged families and families of color. As
        more is learned about the underlying reasons for, and consequences of, child
        custody decisions, it is hoped that low-income parents and caregivers will
        benefit from this research if programs and policies are designed to better
        reflect their needs. These results may also inform research-based curricula
        used in programs which teach parenting and coparenting skills to caregivers.
        Moreover, it may help parenting educators develop outreach and education strategies
        for families who do not currently participate in their programs. In so doing,
        this project will support the goals of improved parenting practices that result
        in better child and youth outcomes and improved parent/care giving practices
        result in parents and caregivers reporting increased confidence in their roles.","terms":"
