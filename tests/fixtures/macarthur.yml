            <str name="custom_s_description">&lt;p&gt;Toniic is a leading impact investing network serving individuals, family offices, foundations and funds that seeks to increase the flow of impact-oriented capital and services to address global challenges, including an emerging interest in the development of an investment framework for the sustainable development goals (SDGs).&amp;nbsp;Toniic believes that one of the primary reasons investors stay on the sidelines is the lack of compelling quantitative and qualitative data points and case studies that both illustrate the viability of impact investing and demonstrate the business case for the development of impact investing products and services. Researchers lack data-sets to assess questions like how impact risk and impact return is related to financial risk and financial return. The proposed grant contributes to addressing these issues through support for the T100 project – a longitudinal study of the investing experience of Toniic's 100% Impact Network members using impact portfolio tools, directories, case studies and reports. This project is well-positioned to yield widely accessible longitudinal data on the preferences and behaviors of a group of investors, many of whom are providing catalytic capital.&lt;/p&gt;</str>

            <str name="custom_s_description">Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organization, dedicated to ensuring the ability of the earth to nurture life in all its diversity. The purpose of the project is to understand whether and how political will for intact forest conservation can be shaped in Canada, the country with the third largest area of intact forest landscapes on the planet. Greenpeace is designing and implementing a sophisticated communications program with the aim to establish the pan-boreal region, the Great Northern Forest, as one of the planet's most iconic forests, and expand the Canadian and First Nation constituencies that favor greater forest protection. The intended outcome is a shift in public perception and action in support of intact forests. Greenpeace's market research is inteded to establish a baseline of perceptions and shape a campaign with messaging activities that include social media, films, artwork, and education. At the end of the two-year project, the same market research partner will conduct a follow up assessment to identify statistically significant shifts in public perception of intact forests and collect qualitative information around the impact of the campaign.</str>
